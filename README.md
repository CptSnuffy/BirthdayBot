# BirthdayBot
Discord Bot for birthday reminders

This bot needs Python3 to run on your machine.

Need to create a .env file and assign token to your discord bots token
Need to change message_channel_id in birthdaybot.py to your target discord channel

Entered birthdays must be in this format to work correctly: @YOURSELF 08/10 (Month/Day)

I also take commissions for bots. If you are interested in something a little more personalized or have any questions about this bot in particular please add my discord Snuffy#2019
